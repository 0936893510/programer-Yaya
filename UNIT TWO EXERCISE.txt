UNIT TWO EXERCISES
State that a program calculates the product of three numbers
Declare variables a, b, c, and product as integers.
5. Use the input function to read three integers from the keyboard and store them in variables a, b, and c.
6. Multiply the values of a, b, and c together and store the result in the variable product.
7. Print the value of the variable product as the output of the program.
Write a statement for declare a variables x ,y ,z and result to be of type Int
x: int
y: int
z: int
result: int
Write a program that accept two integers and display their , sum,diffrence,product and division of two intigers?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main<>{
}
Int a,b,sum,diff,pro,div;
# Addition
sum = a + b
print("Sum:", sum)

# Subtraction
diff = a - b
print("Difference:", diff)

# Multiplication
product = a * b
print("Product:", product)

# Division
if b == 0:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
else:
    division = a / b
    print("Division:", division
1. Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations. The following are some examples:


a /= b; // a = 10

. Bitwise Operators:
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of a number. The following are some examples:
nt a = 10, b = 5;
int result1 = (a & b); // 0
int result2 = (a | b); // 15
int result3 = (a ^ b); // 15
int result4 = (~a); // -11
int result5 = (a << 2); // 40
int result6 = (a >> 2); // 



Write a program that to solve a quadratic equation hint:y=a(x*x)+bx+c
root=-b-+(b*b-4ac/2a
a = float(input("Enter the value of a: "))
b = float(input("Enter the value of b: "))
c = float(input("Enter the value of c: "))

# calculate the discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# check if the discriminant is positive, negative or zero
if discriminant > 0:
    # calculate the two roots
    root1 = (-b + (discriminant)**0.5) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - (discriminant)**0.5) / (2*a)
    print("The roots are", root1, "and", root2)
elif discriminant == 0:
    # calculate the single root
    root = -b / (2*a)
    print("The root is", root)
else:
    # display imaginary roots
    real_part = -b / (2*a)
    imaginary_part = (-discriminant)**0.5 / (2*a)
    print("The roots are", real_part, "+", imaginary_part, "i and", real_part, "-", imaginary_part, "i")




Examples on character type, constants, input output statement ,increment ,decrement  in c++








Character type example:

char letter = 'A';
cout << letter << endl;

This will output "A".

Constants example:

const int PI = 3.14159;
cout << "The value of PI is: " << PI << endl;

This will output "The value of PI is: 3.14159".

Input/output statement example:

int age;
cout << "Enter your age: ";
cin >> age;
cout << "Your age is: " << age << endl;

This will prompt the user to enter their age and then output it.

Increment example:

int num = 5;
num++;
cout << num << endl;

This will output "6".

Decrement example:

int num = 5;
num--;
cout << num << endl;

This will output "4".
